                        <h2>Why I Created This Website</h2>
                        <p>
                            I built this website to help computer science students who feel lost or unsure about their next
                            steps. My goal is to provide resources, guidance, and tools to bridge the gap between classroom
                            knowledge and real-world skills. Several years ago, I began my programming journey, starting with Java.
                            I then ventured into creating web applications using Java. However, not long after, I started feeling lost
                            and unsure about what to do next. How could I become a better programmer? What does the tech field really look like?

                            Eventually, I lost my motivation and stepped away from programming for a few years.
                            Now, I'm creating this website to help people who might find themselves in a similar situation. My goal is to provide a clear outline of what to do next and how to do it.
                            I hope you find something here that helps you on your journey!
                        </p>

                        <h2>My Recent Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>AI Video Generator App:</strong> Developed a TikTok-like mobile application designed to entertain users with AI-generated videos.
        The app utilized machine learning and deep learning techniques to generate content based on pre-trained models, eliminating the need for
        user-uploaded videos. Designed for offline use, the app provided a seamless user experience without requiring database connections.
        Focused on optimizing performance, I incorporated efficient algorithms for video synthesis and built an intuitive interface to ensure accessibility for younger audiences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ML Dashboard:</strong> Created an interactive web-based machine learning dashboard using Flask and Python.
        The application allows users to upload datasets, select from a variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear
        Regression, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression), and generate predictions with real-time feedback. Integrated
        features include data preprocessing, validation, and performance metrics display to guide users in interpreting results.
        The project also included a clean, responsive UI with JavaScript and CSS, ensuring usability across devices.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Deep Learning Model:</strong> Built and fine-tuned a deep learning model in Python for advanced data analysis tasks.
        Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, I implemented a neural network architecture tailored for image recognition and classification.
        The model was trained on large datasets, employing techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and adaptive learning rates to
        enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. To demonstrate the model's practicality, I developed a visualization module that
        allowed users to interpret predictions and understand the inner workings of the network, making it suitable for educational and professional applications.
    </li>
</ul>
                        <h2>My Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded computer scientist who not only excels in coding but
                            also helps others succeed in their careers. Iâ€™m passionate about creating tools and platforms
                            that simplify learning and make technology accessible to everyone. I also aim to continue developing
                            innovative projects, sharpening my skills, and exploring new opportunities in machine learning and software development.
